# MMA API

Welcome to the MMA API documentation! 

This API provides access to data on mixed martial arts fighters.

This API in its current implementation does not require an API Key.

## Getting Started

The base url is `https://mma-api-production-1e44.up.railway.app/`

## API Endpoints

The MMA API provides the following endpoints:

### Fighters

- `/api/fighters`: Get a list of all fighters.
- `/api/fighters/{firstName-lastName}`: Get details about a specific fighter (Conor-McGregor, Amanda-Nunes, etc).
- `/api/fighters/weight/{weight}`: Get a list of all fighters at a given weight-class (Lightweight, Featherweight, etc).
- `/api/fighters/gender/{gender}`: Get a list of all fighters for a given gender (men/women).
